Our requested donation for adoption is $165.00 ($190 for kittens), and a small donation for our delivery cost. <br>
This adoption donation often covers only a minimal amount of the costs we must expend for veterinary services, etc.. <br>
We will then sign the ADOPTION CONTRACT when we arrive with kitty. <br>
<h4> LIFETIME RETURN POLICY:<br> </h4>
 <p>We offer a Lifetime Return Policy, and we ask that if for any reason you are unable to keep the cat that it is returned to us. <br>
 Because we go the extra mile to insure you will have a healthy and well adjusted cat, we ask that you will keep him safe and well cared for it's lifetime :<br>
 Veterinary visits every year or 2 years, no vaccinations required if kitty will not be introduced to a new cat <br>
 and respect our adoption terms and policies of adoption as outlined in our Adoption Application and Contract.<br></p>
