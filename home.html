<p> We are an organisation that both resuces and offers cat adoption services.</p>
<div class='home'>
<p>We like to call our place a "LET LIVE SAFE HAVEN" where cats can hopefully stay for their lifetimes if they don't find their forever homes. <br>
  For more than 20 years, 1000+ cats have passed through our doors, most of them from the streets.<br>
  Many are seriously injured or sick and would never have survived without intervention. Others we saved moments before euthanasia.<br>
  As soon as they are well, they are spayed or neutered, fully vaccinated, and we ensure our adopters that they are healthy before they leave.<br>
  Sometimes a cat will need extended care & treatments, therefore, our requested donation fee of $165 most always will barely cover our costs. <br>
  But we have done the hard work and the cat only needs you for the TLC and your commitment to care for him/her for its life as a member of your family.<br>
  Matching the right kitty to the right cat companion is our priority. We hear back from adopters many years later and many have come back to re-adopt!<br>
