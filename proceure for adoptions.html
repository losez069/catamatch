<h2>PROCEDURE FOR ADOPTION OR TO FOSTER: <br></h2>
<p>After we have reviewed and if your application is approved in about a day or 2 we will contact you to make an appointment, <br>
 for you to come and visit all of our resident kitties and during your visit you will have ample time to get to know all the cats and see which ones you are most attracted to <br>
 and make that 'special connection! We will provide you with each cat's history of those that you like and make suggestions as to which ones would best suit your lifestyle based on your application and expectations. <br></p>

<h2>AFTER THE VISIT: <br></h2>
<p>You will only have to make one trip to the shelter <br>
1 hour east of Ottawa just off the 417 or 35 minutes from West Island Montreal <br>
because when you visit it has been our experience that 95% of people fall in love with more than one feline that fits their lifestyle so you return home to ponder on your decision and then contact us to discuss your choices. <br>
If we are all in agreement then WE BRING THE NEW KITTY TO YOU! It is also doubly beneficial that the cat enter it's new 'home territory' with someone that he knows which makes the transition quicker and considerably less stressful.<br>
